zettwerk.mobile
===============

Use jquery.mobile with Plone - Apply theme by given hostname(s).

example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwAjqBmdgNk

Important
=========

This is a really rough prototype. Do not use in production instances. Also, there is no clean uninstall profile. Just for testing.

Usage
=====

Install zettwerk.mobile via quickinstaller. Open the view by entering the url: <your_plone_instance>/@@mobile-theming-controlpanel

Enter the hostnames on which the mobile theme should be applied. It is also possible to give an own theme name. As default, the zettwerk.mobile theme is used, which is based on jquery.mobile.

Open your plone instance in a browser, given the hostname you applied.
